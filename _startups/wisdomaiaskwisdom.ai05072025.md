about: "WisdomAI provides AI data analytics that delivers business insights from structured, unstructured, and even \"dirty\" data. The platform allows business managers to ask questions and drill into the details without requiring data analytics teams to run reports. It distinguishes itself through its accuracy, especially when working with messy data, and avoids generating fabricated answers (hallucinations) by utilizing GenAI for query formation instead of answer creation."
