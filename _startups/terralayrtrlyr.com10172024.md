about: "Terralayr is a startup that aggregates grid-scale energy storage assets, virtualizes them, and sells off the capacity to buyers. It functions as an exchange, connecting battery owners with buyers to optimize energy use and avoid penalties for mismatched energy forecasts. This platform addresses the inefficiency in the current energy storage market by acting as a facilitator rather than a trader."
