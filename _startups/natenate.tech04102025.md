about: "Nate was an AI shopping app that aimed to provide a universal checkout experience, allowing users to buy from any e-commerce site with a single click. However, it relied heavily on human contractors to manually complete purchases, despite marketing itself as AI-powered. The app ultimately failed and its assets were sold in 2023."
