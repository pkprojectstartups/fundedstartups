about: "Electra has developed a novel method of using electricity to coax pure iron out of low-grade ores, opening the door to cleaner steel. The company's solution, known as electrowinning, is already used to produce other metals like copper and nickel. Electra's acid-based process can handle lower-grade ores and is ideal feedstock for electric-arc furnaces, which can also run on renewable energy."
